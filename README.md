#Examples of work

Examples of data work from past projects. 

## binequality
I am a coauthor of an R package that performs multi-model estimation of income distribution from binned data. The code is [at Sam Scarpino's GitHub](https://github.com/scarpino/binequality)

This method, originaly built in SAS then rebuilt in R, was published in a [handful](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0200) of [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4061): 


## UCR_macro.sas
This is a SAS 9.2 syntax reading in raw [FBI Unified Criminal Reporting](https://ucr.fbi.gov/) data, cleaning and aggregating to State level. Along the way the data is merged with US Census population estimates to calcuate crime rates per 1000 citizens. 

This macro, modified for distribution, is published [here](https://github.com/iholas/ucr_read). I am also re-working the method into a [Python script](https://github.com/iholas/ucr_read.py)

The data cleaned thorugh this macro was part of my contribution to this [book](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319148175)


## group_comparison_constrained.out 
This is an MPlus OUT file (log and results) which was part of masters thesis. In this script test whether the path-analytic model is equivalent for male and female students -- particulaty, here is force the model paramters to be equal between the groups to see if this forced restriction deteriorates model fit.  

This work resulted in my masters [thesis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=tWbk-PUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=tWbk-PUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) and a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51854488_Are_Middle_Schools_Harmful_The_Role_of_Transition_Timing_Classroom_Quality_and_School_Characteristics)
