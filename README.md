#Examples of work

Examples of data work from past projects. 

## UCR_macro.sas 
This is a SAS 9.2 syntax reading in raw [FBI Unified Criminal Reporting[(https://ucr.fbi.gov/) data, cleaning and aggregating to State level. Along the way the data is merged with US Census population estimates to calcuate crime rates per 1000 citizens. 

The data cleaned thorugh this macro was key to a book I co-authored in 2016:

*Corporal Punishment in U.S. Public Schools:Legal Precedents, Current Practices, and Future Policy*<br/>
Gershoff, Elizabeth, Purtell, Kelly M., Holas, Igor<br/>

## group_comparison_constrained.out 
This is an MPlus OUT file (log and results) which was part of masters thesis. In this file I read my complex regression model, and compare the parameters between two groups. In this particular file, I constrained the parameters to be equal in both groups testing the model-fit deterioration under this forced condition. 

This work resulted in my masters thesis and a paper:
