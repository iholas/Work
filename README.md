#Examples of work

Examples of data work from past projects. 

## UCR_macro.sas 
This is a SAS 9.2 syntax reading in raw [FBI Unified Criminal Reporting](https://ucr.fbi.gov/) data, cleaning and aggregating to State level. Along the way the data is merged with US Census population estimates to calcuate crime rates per 1000 citizens. 

This macro, modified for distribution, is published [here](https://github.com/iholas/ucr_read).

The data cleaned thorugh this macro was part of my contribution to this book:

*Corporal Punishment in U.S. Public Schools:Legal Precedents, Current Practices, and Future Policy*<br/>

## group_comparison_constrained.out 
This is an MPlus OUT file (log and results) which was part of masters thesis. In this script test whether the path-analytic model is equivalent for male and female students -- particulaty, here is force the model paramters to be equal between the groups to see if this forced restriction deteriorates model fit.  

This work resulted in my masters thesis and a paper:
